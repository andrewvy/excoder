TODO:

### Make encoding back-end agnostica (#1)

[ ] Make behaviour for transcoding back-end adapters.

### Video Transcoding adapters:

[ ] Zencoder
[ ] Amazon Elastic Transcoder
[ ] ffmpeg (local)

### HTTP JSON API (#3)

[ ] Add Plug
[ ] GET /jobs endpoint
[ ] POST /jobs endpoint
[ ] GET /jobs/:uuid endpoint
[ ] DELETE /jobs/:uuid endpoint

---

- Make agnostic video transcoding settings that can be passed into the transcoding adapters.
- Job architecture
  - Creating a job
  - Sending jobs into our worker pool (which then gets shipped to our transcoding adapters)
  - Getting job status
  - Cancelling jobs

Input -> Job -> [Outputs]
          |
          |
      Job Status

- Two types of sources: file-system / URL-based (should be handled by the adapter)
- Transcoding presets?

Questions:

Do we want the ability to have multiple adapters? (probably no)
Do we want the ability to set transcoding presets? (yes)
